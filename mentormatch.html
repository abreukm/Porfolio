								experience and build thier professional network

                     				<h3><hr>The Problem</h3> 
                           			 <p style="text-align:left;"><br> Many skilled workers come to Canada and can’t find work in their field despite having the right technical skills.

								 		<br>•The government of Canada predicts that almost one million immigrants will enter the country over the next three years

										<br>•Most of them will be highly educated and skilled professionals

										<br>•Most of these skilled workers face challenges finding work even 4 years after arrival 

										<br>•Foreign experience and credentials not being recognized and employers require Canadian Experience

										<br>•Only 24% of professional immigrants are working in field of expertise. This can lead 
							to underemployment and feelings of anxiety and uncertainty of how to proceed. </p>

							<h3><hr>The Goal</h3>
								 <p style="text-align:left;"><br>To design a solution to meet the needs of the new immigrant community in Canada. 
								<br><br>•The Team: Karina Abreu, Emily Bergeron, Rhea Makund 
								<br>•My Role: user research, competitive intelligence research, usability testing, research & evaluation data analysis
								<br>•The Timeline: 12 weeks
								<br>•The Process:

								
								 <br><br>• User Research & Analysis
								 <br>• Requirements Analysis
								 <br>• Prototypes
								 <br>• Evaluation & Next Steps 
								 </p>
								
                            <h3><hr>User Research</h3> 
                        
									<br><h4>Methods<br></h4><p style="text-align:left;">
									
							<br>•User Interviews: Semi-structured interviews with 7 new immigrants from past 4 years
									
							<br>•Digial Ethnography: Study of online social interactions between new immigrants
									
							<br>•SME Interviews: Semi-structured interviews with 2 Subject Matter Experts (SME)</p>
									
								<h4>Key Findings<br></h4><p style="text-align:left;">
										<br>•Newcomers arrive as skilled workers & have an expectation they will find work in their field

										<br>•Newcomers have few contacts/no network

										<br>•Employers want applicants to have Canadian experience, as international experience & credentials are not recognized

										<br>•Newcomer services focus on basic needs, no focus on getting new Canadians job ready

										<br>•Learning about Canadian norms and culture are important for successfully landing a job 

										<br>•The current situation creates a system where skilled workers are resentful, underemployed, and hoping from one survival job to the next
							</p>
										<h3><hr>Understanding the User</h3> 
							
											<br><h4>Persona<br></h4><p style="text-align:left;">
								<br>Using our research findings, we created a persona to better understand our users, thier goals and frustrations. 	
								<br><br>Meet Tanvi Sharma<br></p>
								<img src="images/tanvi.jpg" style="width:850px;height:765px;"></a>
								
								<p style="text-align:left;">

								<h4>The Current Job Hunting Process<br></h4>

								<img src="images/jobhunt.png" style="width:806px;height:453px;"></a>

							<p style="text-align:left;"><br> We used the findings from our research study to define a solution to help new immigrants like Tanvi gain Canadian experience.  
								
								<h4>To find work Tanvi needs to...</h4><p style="text-align:left;">
								
								<br>•Learn about Canadian workplace culture so that she can demonstrate to employers that she can fit-in and assimilate
								<br>•Connect with other internationally trained professionals who are established in her field so that she can learn from thier experience 
								<br>•Get recognition of her foreign credentials and experience so that she can be considered for roles that she is qualified for

								<h3><hr>Ideation</h3><p style="text-align:left;">

								Based on Tanvi's need, we came up with a series of ideas that could hekp her achieve her goals of fiding relevant work in her field. 
								We combined the ideas we generated into bigger themes, voted and prioritized ideas based on their impact in addressing Tanvi’s pain points - 
								and the feasibility of executing each. </p>

								<img src="images/ideas.png" style="width:806px;height:453px;"></a>
								<p style="text-align:left;">
								<br>Mentorship came out as the winning idea. Based on our research, it was clear that new immigrants 
								had a strong need for advice and guidance throughout their journey in finding relevant work in Canada.

								<h4>What is wrong with current mentorship programs?</h4><p style="text-align:left;">

									<br>•Low awareness: newcomers are not aware of of these programs, either because of lack of marketing, or simply because they don’t know 
									these types of programs exist because they’re not common in their home country. 
									<br>•Not enough mentors: despite low awareness, there is still not enough mentors to meet demand
									<br>•Not accessable to all: mentoring programs are offered in-person, limiting their availability

									<br><BR><i>How do we make the outcome of a mentorship program more tangible, more real, and valuable?</i></p>

									
									<h4>Our solution: Mentor Match</h4><p style="text-align:left;">
										<br>Mentor Match is an online service that helps new immigrants start a successful career in Canada through mentorship and
										facilitated work experiences. A mentor can help Tanvi build knowledge of the Canadian market, workplace norms and culture. Once Tanvi
										 is ready, her mentor will help her secure mini-internships and job-shadowing opportunities - the tangible hands-on experiences
										  that new immigrants are looking for to add Canadian experience to their resume.
